    "text": "1 Introduction\nFor most people infected with COVID-19, the symptoms are no more than a common cold, including fever or chills, cough, and fatigue. However, for some infected with COVID-19, the symptoms can continue for weeks, months, or even years after contracting the disease. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), alongside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has defined these extended symptoms as Long COVID. Specifically, the CDC has defined Long COVID as “signs, symptoms, and conditions that continue or develop after acute COVID-19 infection”. An overview of the various symptoms and their approximate prevalence can be seen below:\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the widespread presence of COVID-19 in the United States, especially looking at the past three years, interest in the long-term effects of COVID-19 infection has been high among scientific researchers and public health officials alike. However, while research has shown that people who experience more severe COVID-19 symptoms are more likely to develop Long COVID, including those who are unvaccinated, little is known about who exactly experiences Long COVID and why. This discrepancy between the high prevalence of Long COVID and the relatively little known about it inspired us to dig deeper into Long COVID datasets, in order to gain insight into what demographics are most likely to suffer long-term effects from COVID-19. In particular, we are interested in the following questions:\n\nHow big of a problem actually is Long COVID? Have reported cases increased over the past year, decreased, or remained relatively constant, and what percentage of adults in the US are actually impacted?\nDo factors like age, education, disability status, or geographic location impact the likelihood to develop Long COVID? If so, what factors are most impactful?\nWhat impact does Long COVID have on various health metrics, such as level of fatigue or activity metrics?\n\nBy answering these questions, we hope to better inform health policy officials when it comes to allocation of resources for diagnosing and treating Long COVID. Additionally, we aim to answer questions as to the true effects of Long COVID on health when viewed on a large scale.\nReferences:\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Long_term_covid-19.jpg\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html\nhttps://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Post-COVID-Conditions/gsea-w83j\nhttps://catalog.data.gov/dataset/post-covid-conditions-89bb3"

    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\n\n2.1.1 Dataset Source\nThe dataset used for this project is survey data from the Household Pulse Survey, a survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau designed to measure household experiences during the coronavirus pandemic. The Household Pulse Survey was administered starting in April 2020, and has been routinely administered on a two-weeks on, two-weeks off cycle since then. More complete information on the survey can be found on the Census Bureau website here, and the exact timing of data collection can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to analyze the prevalence and effects of Long COVID among various demographics, we used a subset of the questions asked on the Household Pulse Survey that were specific to post-COVID-19 conditions. These questions focus on the occurrence of COVID symptoms that lasted at least three months post-testing positive for COVID-19, and were introduced beginning in Phase 3.5 of the Household Pulse Survey (on June 1, 2022). Responses to these questions were then collated by the National Center for Health Statistics, which were then published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This dataset, which was last updated on October 12, 2023 (following the conclusion of Phase 3.9) can be found on the CDC website here.\n\n\n2.1.2 Dataset Overview\nThe dataset was directly downloaded from the CDC as a csv file. It consists of 14 columns and 11376 rows and contains the estimates of:\n\nThe percentage of all U.S. adults who said they ever had COVID.\nThe percentage of all U.S. adults who ever experienced post-COVID conditions.\nThe percentage of all U.S. adults who ever experienced post-COVID conditions among those who ever had COVID.\nThe percentage of all U.S. adults who are currently experiencing post-COVID conditions.\nThe percentage of adults who are currently experiencing post-COVID conditions (long COVID) among those who ever had COVID.\n\nAdditionally, starting on September 14, 2022 (Phase 3.6) the following responses were also included:\n\nThe percentage of U.S. adults currently experiencing any activity limitations (either ‘yes, a little’ or ‘yes, a lot’ responses) from long COVID, either among adults who are currently experiencing long COVID or among all adults.\nThe percentage of U.S. adults currently experiencing significant activity limitations (‘yes, a lot’ response) from long COVID, either among adults who are currently experiencing long COVID or among all adults.\n\nThe primary columns of the dataset are:\n\nIndicator: one of the categories (a-g) presented above.\nGroup: The grouping of the population on which the percentages are measured. Included groupings are National Estimate (aggregated proportion across all U.S. adults), age, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, education status, disability status, and state.\nState: Either the state that the state grouping corresponds to (if applicable), or United States.\nSubgroup: The category within the group specified by Group if not grouped by state, or equal to state otherwise.\nPhase, Time Period, Time Period Label: values regarding the time period of the data collection, including the Phase of data collection, time period the data was collected, and label for the time period.\nTime Period Start Date\nTime Period End Date\nValue: Estimate of the proportion of adults experiencing symptoms, with exact symptoms and conditions outlined in the indicator, group, and subgroup columns.\n\nThe dataset contains additional columns with confidence intervals and quartile information as related to the value column. Specifically, the dataset contains columns for the low confidence interval bound (LowCI), high confidence interval bound (HighCI), Confidence Interval, Quartile Number (Either 1, 2, 3, or 4), and Quartile Range. An additional column Suppression Flag is also present, which contains a value of 1 if the value in Value is unreliable and is empty otherwise.\nAs part of the data release process, the CDC also acknowledged several limitations and concerns with the study, which are outlined in full on the CDC summary page for the Household Pulse Survey found here. The most important limitations and concerns are outlined below:\n\nThroughout the duration of the data collection process, response rates across various demographics were relatively low. In fact, when adjusted for nonresponse and to match Census Bureau estimates of the population by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment, response rates ranged from 3.9%-7.3%, which is much lower than most federally-sponsored surveys.\nConfidence intervals included in the tables on this page only reflect the potential for sampling error. These intervals do not account for various nonsampling errors, including measurement errors, nonresponse errors, or processing errors.\nThe percentage of adults who said they ever had COVID based on the Household Pulse Survey is lower than other estimates based on seroprevalence studies. This discrepancy between reported COVID cases and true COVID cases based on blood serum is likely due to the relatively high percentage of asymptomatic individuals with COVID, but is still worth noting."

    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\nDue to the structure of our dataset, we will be able to use our data to answer all of our research questions proposed in the introduction:\nQuestion 1: How big of a problem actually is Long COVID? Have reported cases increased over the past year, decreased, or remained relatively constant, and what percentage of adults in the US are actually impacted?\nIn order to assess the prevalence of Long COVID across the entire adult population in the United States, we will primarily use the aggregated responses recorded in the National Estimate level of Group, as this contains the total proportion of all adults in the U.S. affected by some aspect of Long COVID. It is important to note here that we will not be looking at any demographic information yet, only the totals across all adults in the U.S. Additionally, even while sticking to the national estimates, we still have a number of aspects of Long COVID that we are able to investigate. For one, we can use the various levels of Indicator to assess what proportion of adults ever experienced Long COVID, either as a percentage of all adults or as a percentage of all adults that ever had COVID. We can also use the levels of Indicator to assess what proportion of adults are currently Long COVID, either as a percentage of all adults or as a percentage of all adults that ever had COVID. Finally, we can combine this information with the information stored in the various time period columns, including Time Period Label, Time Period Start Date, and Time Period End Date, in order to see how these proportions change over time. By doing so, we will be able to see how incidences of Long COVID have changed over the past two years, both in terms of total levels and in terms of current cases.\nQuestion 2: Do factors like age, education, disability status, or geographic location impact the likelihood to develop Long COVID? If so, what factors are most impactful?\nIn our dataset, all demographic information is contained as categorical variables within the Group, Subgroup, and State columns. By filtering data using the Group column, we will be able to select populations based on a single demographic identifier at a time, such as age, disability status, or geographic location (by state). We can then use the identifying information contained within either the Subgroup column or the State column to compare the proportion stored in Value across each of the different subgroups for each of the different demographics contained in the dataset. For this analysis, since we are most interested if certain demographics are at an increased risk to develop Long COVID, we will focus on the same levels of Indicator that we focused on in our analysis of question 1, in particular the proportion of adults that ever experienced Long COVID as a percentage of all adults and the proportion of adults that are currently experiencing Long COVID as a percentage of all adults.\nQuestion 3: What impact does Long COVID have on various health metrics, such as level of fatigue or activity metrics?\nTo investigate if Long COVID has a tangible impact on various health metrics, we aim to use activity limitations as a function of Long COVID as an indicator of overall health. This information is again stored in the Indicator column, including both the percentage of adults currently experiencing any activity limitations in response to Long COVID and the percentage of adults currently experiencing significant activity limitations in response to Long COVID. If we now substitute this indicator into our analyses for questions 1 and 2, we will not only be able to measure how prevalent activity limitations are among Long COVID patients over the time course of the survey, but also whether or not certain demographics are most at risk for more severe activity limitations. This question will likely be most important for addressing what populations are actually at the highest risk for long-term complications from COVID-19, and in turn will allow us to best advise allocation of resources for COVID prevention and treatment."

    "section": "2.3 Missing value analysis",
    "text": "2.3 Missing value analysis\nIn order to investigate the presence of missing values, we first wanted to see what columns contained missing values, and how many missing values they contained. To do so, we calculated the sum of the NA’s in each column, and graphed them in the bar chart below. It is also worth noting that the Quartile Range column initially stores all NA’s as empty characters (““), and thus these values need to be converted to NA’s in order to properly count the number of NA’s in each column.\n\n\nCode\n# Import Required Libraries\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(forcats)\n\n# Import Data\npcc &lt;- read.csv(\"Post-COVID_Conditions.csv\")\npcc$Quartile.range &lt;- ifelse(pcc$Quartile.range == \"\", NA, pcc$Quartile.range)\n\n# Get the total number of NA's by column\nna_sum &lt;- apply(pcc, 2, function (x) sum(is.na(x)))\n\n# Store as a new dataframe\nna_sum &lt;- as.data.frame(na_sum)\nna_sum$Column &lt;- rownames(na_sum)\n\n# Make a bar graph of the number of NA's by column\nggplot(na_sum, aes(x = na_sum, y = fct_reorder(Column, na_sum))) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#0073C2FF\", color = \"black\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Number of NA's by Column\") +\n  xlab(\"Number of NA's\") +\n  ylab(\"Column\") +\n  theme_linedraw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the graph above, it seems likely that rows with no stored quartile number also have no stored quartile range, and similarly, rows that do not contain a stored value also do not contain a low or high confidence interval bound. Additionally, the large number of rows that contain an NA for Suppression Flag suggests that most rows in the dataset do not contain a value of 1 for Suppression Flag, indicating that most rows in the dataset contain reliable estimates for Value.\nTo quickly confirm if rows with no stored quartile number also have no stored quartile range, we filtered the data for only rows that contained NA’s in both the Quartile Number and Quartile Range columns, and compared the number of rows to the number of total rows that contain an NA in either of the two columns. Similarly, to confirm if rows that do not contain a stored value also do not contain a low or high confidence interval bound, we filtered the data for only rows that contained NA’s in the Value, LowCI, and HighCI columns, and compared the number of rows to the number of total rows that contain an NA in any of the three columns.\n\n\nCode\n# Get only rows that have an NA in Quartile Number AND Quartile Range\nQNandQR &lt;- pcc %&gt;%\n  filter(is.na(Quartile.number) & is.na(Quartile.range))\n\nprint(paste(\"The number of rows that have NA's in Quartile Number AND Quartile Range:\", nrow(QNandQR)))\n\n\n[1] \"The number of rows that have NA's in Quartile Number AND Quartile Range: 4185\"\n\n\nCode\n# Get only rows that have an NA in Quartile Number OR Quartile Range\nQNorQR &lt;- pcc %&gt;%\n  filter(is.na(Quartile.number) | is.na(Quartile.range))\n\nprint(paste(\"The number of rows that have NA's in Quartile Number OR Quartile Range:\", nrow(QNorQR)))\n\n\n[1] \"The number of rows that have NA's in Quartile Number OR Quartile Range: 4190\"\n\n\nCode\n# Get only rows that have an NA in Value, LowCI, AND HighCI\nVandLCIandHCI &lt;- pcc %&gt;%\n  filter(is.na(Value) & is.na(LowCI) & is.na(HighCI))\n\nprint(paste(\"The number of rows that have NA's in Value, LowCI, AND HighCI:\",nrow(VandLCIandHCI)))\n\n\n[1] \"The number of rows that have NA's in Value, LowCI, AND HighCI: 1399\"\n\n\nCode\n# Get only rows that have an NA in Value, LowCI, OR HighCI\nVorLCIorHCI &lt;- pcc %&gt;%\n  filter(is.na(Value) | is.na(LowCI) | is.na(HighCI))\n\nprint(paste(\"The number of rows that have NA's in Value, LowCI, OR HighCI:\",nrow(VorLCIorHCI)))\n\n\n[1] \"The number of rows that have NA's in Value, LowCI, OR HighCI: 1399\"\n\n\nFrom these lines, we can see that all rows that contain NA values in Value also contain NA values in LowCI and HighCI. This makes sense, since we cannot have a confidence interval for a value if the value does not exist. Similarly, almost all rows that have NA’s in Quartile Number also have NA’s in Quartile Range. Furthermore, when looking at the rows where there is an NA in either Quartile Number or Quartile Range but not both, we observed that the value of Suppression Flag for these rows is 1, indicating that the observation is unreliable. For safety, we set the value of Value, LowCI, HighCI, Quartile Number, and Quartile Range to be NA’s if the value of Suppression Flag is 1, to prevent this issue in future analyses.\n\n\nCode\n# Change the values to NA according to the paragraph above\npcc$Value &lt;- ifelse(is.na(pcc$Suppression.Flag), pcc$Value, NA)\npcc$LowCI &lt;- ifelse(is.na(pcc$Suppression.Flag), pcc$LowCI, NA)\npcc$HighCI &lt;- ifelse(is.na(pcc$Suppression.Flag), pcc$HighCI, NA)\npcc$Quartile.range &lt;- ifelse(is.na(pcc$Suppression.Flag), pcc$Quartile.range, NA)\npcc$Quartile.number &lt;- ifelse(is.na(pcc$Suppression.Flag), pcc$Quartile.number, NA)\n\n\nWith the overall trends of what columns contain NA values known, we know wanted to gain further insight into what exact row values or experimental conditions resulted in NA values. To do so, we first looked at whether or not specific time periods contained higher levels of NA values than others. This was accomplished using a heatmap of number of NA’s in the Value column, grouped by each time period. Specifically, we took the total number of NA’s in each time period and divided by the total number of rows in each time period, in order to get the proportion of observations that had NA’s in value for each time period.\n\n\nCode\n# Group the total NA's by Time Period Label and store as a new DF\nDate_NAs &lt;- pcc %&gt;%\n  mutate(NA_indicator = is.na(Value)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Time.Period.Label, NA_indicator) %&gt;%\n  summarize(NA_count = sum(NA_indicator)) %&gt;%\n  filter(NA_indicator == TRUE)\n\n# Get the number of rows with each time period label and store it in our new DF\nPeriod_Label_Counts &lt;- as.numeric(as.matrix(table(pcc$Time.Period.Label)))\nDate_NAs$Counts &lt;- Period_Label_Counts\n\n# Create new column which is NA Counts / Period Label Counts\nDate_NAs$NAoverTotal &lt;- Date_NAs$NA_count / Date_NAs$Counts\n\n# Convert the new TPL to a factor (used below)\nDate_NAs$Time.Period.Label &lt;- as.factor(Date_NAs$Time.Period.Label)\n\n# Create the heatmap: requires manual reordering of the labels\nDate_NAs %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = \"\", y = fct_rev(fct_relevel(Time.Period.Label, \"Jun 1 - Jun 13, 2022\", \"Jun 29 - Jul 11, 2022\", \n                                             \"Jul 27 - Aug 8, 2022\", \"Aug 24 - Sep 13, 2022\", \"Sep 14 - Sep 26, 2022\",\n                                             \"Oct 5 - Oct 17, 2022\", \"Nov 2 - Nov 14, 2022\", \"Nov 30 - Dec 8, 2022\",\n                                             \"Dec 9 - Dec 19, 2022\", \"Jan 4 - Jan 16, 2023\", \"Feb 1 - Feb 13, 2023\",\n                                             \"Mar 1 - Mar 13, 2023\", \"Mar 29 - Apr 10, 2023\", \"Apr 26 - May 8, 2023\",\n                                             \"Jun 7 - Jun 19, 2023\", \"Jun 28 - Jul 10, 2023\", \"Jul 26 - Aug 7, 2023\",\n                                             \"Aug 23 - Sep 4, 2023\", \"Sep 20 - Oct 2, 2023\")), \n             fill = NAoverTotal)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"#E7E7E7\", high = \"#FF1B1B\", name = \"NA Counts / \\nNumber Rows\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Number of NA's in Value / Number of Rows for each Time Period\") +\n  xlab(\"\") +\n  ylab(\"Time Period\") +\n  theme_linedraw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the heatmap above, we observe a major jump in the proportion of NA values between Jul 27 - Aug 8, 2022 and Aug 24 - Sep 13, 2022. We also see a large proportion of NA values during the Nov 30 - Dec 8, 2022 time period. Both of these observations make sense, given that these time periods correspond with breaks in the survey during which no information was collected. Since data weren’t collected during those periods, and both periods had a 100% incidence of NA values, we chose to remove those rows from the dataset for future analyses.\n\n\nCode\n# Remove dates that correspond to breaks of data collection\npcc &lt;- pcc %&gt;%\n  filter(Time.Period.Label != \"Aug 24 - Sep 13, 2022\" & Time.Period.Label != \"Nov 30 - Dec 8, 2022\")\n\n\nNow, if we check the remaining rows that contain NA’s, we see that all the other rows with NA values in Value are only due to the estimate not being reliable (Suppression Flag equal to 1). This indicates that all current NA values in Value are accounted for by known errors in the dataset.\n\n\nCode\nVandSF &lt;- pcc%&gt;%\n  filter(is.na(Value) & is.na(Suppression.Flag))\n\nprint(paste(\"The number of remaining rows that have NA's in Value without the Suppression flag being raised:\", nrow(VandSF)))\n\n\n[1] \"The number of remaining rows that have NA's in Value without the Suppression flag being raised: 0\"\n\n\nLastly, since many rows contained NA values in Quartile Number and Quartile Range, we now wanted to see if there were any trends in what rows contained NA values in these columns. To do so, we created a heatmap of the number of NA’s in the Quartile Number column, grouped by level in Group. Again, we took the total number of NA’s in each group and divided by the total number of rows in each group, in order to get the proportion of observations that had NA’s in value for each group.\n\n\nCode\n# Group the total NA's by Group and store as a new DF\nGroup_NAs &lt;- pcc %&gt;%\n  mutate(NA_indicator = is.na(Quartile.number)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Group, NA_indicator) %&gt;%\n  summarize(NA_count = sum(NA_indicator)) %&gt;%\n  filter(NA_indicator == TRUE)\n\n# Get the number of rows with each group and store it in our new DF\nGroup_Counts &lt;- as.numeric(as.matrix(table(pcc$Group)))\nGroup_NAs$Counts &lt;- Group_Counts\n\n# Create new column which is NA Counts / Period Label Counts\nGroup_NAs$NAoverTotal &lt;- Group_NAs$NA_count / Group_NAs$Counts\n\n# Create the heatmap: requires manual reordering of the labels\nGroup_NAs %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = \"\", y = Group, fill = NAoverTotal)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"#E7E7E7\", high = \"#FF1B1B\", name = \"NA Counts / \\nNumber Rows\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Number of NA's in Quartile Number / Number of Rows for each Group\") +\n  xlab(\"\") +\n  ylab(\"Group\") +\n  theme_linedraw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the heatmap, we can see that the only group that does not contain all NA values in Quartile Number (and thus, also in Quartile Range) is grouping by state. Likely, this is because quartiles can only be calculated when there are a sufficient number of different subgroups within a given group. As such, since there are over 50 states included as subgroups when grouping by state (all 50 states + Washington DC), quartiles can be calculateed when grouping by state. However, for the other variables with much fewer subgroups, calculating a quartile number and quartile range is not feasible, and thus these values are excluded from the dataset.\nReferences:\n\nhttps://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/household-pulse-survey.html\nhttps://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Post-COVID-Conditions/gsea-w83j"

    "text": "3.1 Investigating the Trends in Long COVID Prevalence\nOur initial objective was to gain insight into the prevalence of Long COVID in the United States. Ultimately, our goal is to figure out what groups are affected most by Long COVID in order to best inform health policy officials when it comes to allocation of resources for diagnosis and treatment, but if Long COVID has low prevalence or shows decreasing trends in prevalence, these interventions might have limited efficacy. As such, it is important to first establish a baseline of what overall proportion of adults in the United States are either currently experiencing post-COVID-related symptoms, or have experienced such symptoms in the past.\nTo answer this question best, we chose to look at only rows in our dataset containing the National Estimates for Long COVID cases among adults in the U.S., as these rows will give us the best overview of trends in cases. We did so by first filtering our data to select the rows contianing a value of “National Estimate” in the Group column, and then only chose to keep the columns for Indicator, Group, Time.Period.Start.Date, Time.Period.End.Data, and Value.\n\n\nCode\n# Import Required Libraries\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(forcats)\n\n# Import Data\npcc &lt;- read.csv(\"Post-COVID_Conditions.csv\")\n\n# Filter the data according to the workflow above\nTimeData &lt;- pcc %&gt;% filter(Group == 'National Estimate') %&gt;% select(c(Indicator, Group, Time.Period.Start.Date, Time.Period.End.Date, Value))\n\n# Also need to convert the Time Period Colums to dates\nTimeData$Time.Period.Start.Date &lt;- as.Date(TimeData$Time.Period.Start.Date, format = \"%m/%d/%Y\")\n#TimeData$Time.Period.Start.Date &lt;- format(TimeData$Time.Period.Start.Date, \"%B %d, %Y\")\n\nTimeData$Time.Period.End.Date&lt;- as.Date(TimeData$Time.Period.End.Date, format = \"%m/%d/%Y\")\n#TimeData$Time.Period.End.Date &lt;- format(TimeData$Time.Period.End.Date, \"%B %d, %Y\")\n\n\nWith the data filtered, we now looked at each indicator one at a time to identify overall trends in Long COVID cases in the United States. Since we wanted to look at the prevalence of Long COVID, we first looked at adults that are currently experiencing Long COVID, either as a percentage of adults who ever had COVID or as a percentage of all adults in the U.S.\n\n\nCode\nCurrentExp &lt;- TimeData %&gt;% filter(Indicator == \"Currently experiencing long COVID, as a percentage of adults who ever had COVID\" | Indicator == \"Currently experiencing long COVID, as a percentage of all adults\")\n\nCurrentExp &lt;- na.omit(CurrentExp)\n\nCurrentExp$Indicator &lt;- recode(CurrentExp$Indicator, \"Currently experiencing long COVID, as a percentage of adults who ever had COVID\" = \"As a % of Adults who have ever had COVID\", \"Currently experiencing long COVID, as a percentage of all adults\" = \"As a % of All Adults\")\n\nggplot(CurrentExp, aes(x = Time.Period.Start.Date, y = Value, color = Indicator)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"Currently Experiencing Long COVID\") + \n  xlab(\"Data Collection Start Date\") +\n  ylab(\"Percentage\") +\n  scale_x_date(labels = scales::date_format(\"%b, %Y\"), breaks = \"2 month\") +\n  theme_linedraw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  labs(color = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the graph, we see that overall, the proportion of adults that are currently experiencing Long COVID has consistently decreased over the course of the data collection across both cohorts, particularly when looking at the adults that are currently experiencing Long COVID and comparing it to all adults who have ever had COVID. However, this trend seems to be leveling off around 10%, suggesting that around 10% of adults that get COVID also suffer from post-COVID symptoms of some severity. Since this percentage is relatively high, support for Long COVID diagnosis and treatment still should be advised.\nThe dataset also contains responses for adults that have ever experienced Long COVID, either as a percentage of adults who have ever had COVID or as a percentage of all adults. In order to see how prevalent Long COVID has been over the course of the pandemic, we also wanted to see how trends in the overall number of adults impacted by Long COVID have changed over the survey duration. For this analysis, we again only selected rows in our dataset containing the National Estimates for Long COVID cases among adults in the U.S.\n\n\nCode\nEverExp &lt;- TimeData %&gt;% filter(Indicator == \"Ever experienced long COVID, as a percentage of adults who ever had COVID\" | Indicator == \"Ever experienced long COVID, as a percentage of all adults\")\n\nEverExp &lt;- na.omit(EverExp)\n\nEverExp$Indicator &lt;- recode(EverExp$Indicator, \"Ever experienced long COVID, as a percentage of adults who ever had COVID\" = \"As a % of Adults who have ever had COVID\", \"Ever experienced long COVID, as a percentage of all adults\" = \"As a % of All Adults\")\n\nggplot(EverExp, aes(x = Time.Period.Start.Date, y = Value, color = Indicator)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"Ever Experienced Long COVID\") + \n  xlab(\"Data Collection Start Date\") +\n  ylab(\"Percentage\") +\n  scale_x_date(labels = scales::date_format(\"%b, %Y\"), breaks = \"2 month\") +\n  theme_linedraw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  labs(color = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the graph above, we expect the proportion of adults who have ever experienced Long COVID to increase, as each time the survey is answered, all people that have previously had Long COVID should respond yes, along with all people that have newly contacted Long COVID. While this trend is observed in the proportion of adults who have ever experienced Long COVID as a percentage of all adults, it is not the case for the proportion of adults who have ever experienced Long COVID as a percentage of all adults who ever had COVID. It is possible that this result is an artifact of the data collection process, but the exact reason cannot be uncovered by information in the dataset alone."

    "text": "3.2 Determining the Key Factors that Affect Long COVID Suspectibility\nUsing the graphs below, we attempted to get an understanding regarding which factors seem to have an effect on the likelihood of developing long COVID and how large of an effect that can be.\n\n\nCode\n# Preprocessing\n\npcc &lt;- pcc %&gt;%\n  mutate(Phase = factor(ifelse(Phase == 3.1 ,\"3.10\", as.character(Phase)), levels = c(\"3.5\",\"3.6\",\"3.7\",\"3.8\",\"3.9\",\"3.10\"))) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Subgroup = factor(Subgroup,levels(fct_relevel(pcc$Subgroup,\"Less than a high school diploma\",\"High school diploma or GED\",\"Some college/Associate's degree\",\"Bachelor's degree or higher\")))) %&gt;%\n  select(Indicator, Group, Subgroup, Phase, Value) %&gt;%\n  na.omit()\n\n\n\n\nCode\npcc %&gt;%\n  filter(Group == \"By Age\") %&gt;%\n  filter(Indicator == \"Ever experienced long COVID, as a percentage of adults who ever had COVID\" | Indicator == \"Currently experiencing long COVID, as a percentage of adults who ever had COVID\") %&gt;%\n  select(Subgroup, Phase, Value, Indicator) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Subgroup, y = Value, fill = Indicator)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"summary\",fun=\"mean\", position='dodge') +\n  facet_wrap(~ Phase) +\n  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c(\"Currently experiencing long COVID\", \"Ever experienced long COVID\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Percentage per Age Group\", x = \"Age Group\", y = \"Percentage\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  \n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the graph we can observe that age seems to play a role, to some extend, since for all phases the same pattern was observed. Middle aged people seem to be more susceptible, with a peak at 50-59 years old.\nHowever, as time passes, the differences seem to get smaller between age groups, almost disappearing but the pattern for the people who claim that they have experienced long COVID at some point, remains unchanged. It is also worth pointing out that the percentage of people above 80 years old experiencing long COVID during phases 3.6 and 3.8 increased.\nLastly, we can notice that while the percentages of people below the age of 40 experiencing long COVID during each period are lower than that of people above the age of 60, the opposite can be observed when it comes to the percentages of people ever experiencing long COVID. This could be an indicator that younger people might be more susceptible to experiencing long COVID but their symptoms pass quicker compared to older people who might be less susceptible but experience the symptoms for longer.\n\n\nCode\npcc %&gt;%\n  filter(Group == \"By Sex\") %&gt;%\n  filter(Indicator == \"Ever experienced long COVID, as a percentage of adults who ever had COVID\" | Indicator == \"Currently experiencing long COVID, as a percentage of adults who ever had COVID\") %&gt;%\n  select(Subgroup, Phase, Value, Indicator) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Subgroup, y = Value, fill = Indicator)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"summary\",fun=\"mean\", position='dodge') +\n  facet_wrap(~ Phase) +\n  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c(\"Currently experiencing long COVID\", \"Ever experienced long COVID\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Percentage per Sex\", x = \"Sex\", y = \"Percentage\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding Sex as a factor, it seems to play a more crucial role since the differences between the percentages of females and males are much more significant. Females have been and still are more susceptible than men , more specifically men’s percentages are 2/3 of the female ones.\n\n\nCode\npcc %&gt;%\n  filter(Group == \"By Race/Hispanic ethnicity\") %&gt;%\n  filter(Indicator == \"Ever experienced long COVID, as a percentage of adults who ever had COVID\" | Indicator == \"Currently experiencing long COVID, as a percentage of adults who ever had COVID\") %&gt;%\n  select(Subgroup, Phase, Value, Indicator) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Subgroup, y = Value, fill = Indicator)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"summary\",fun=\"mean\", position='dodge') +\n  facet_wrap(~ Phase) +\n  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c(\"Currently experiencing long COVID\", \"Ever experienced long COVID\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Percentage per Race/Hispanic Ethnicity\", x = \"Race/Hispanic Ethnicity\", y = \"Average Percentage\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nConcerning the Race/Hispanic Ethnicity, Non-Hispanic Asian people are by far the least susceptible to developing long COVID while the Non-Hispanic of multiple races or races other than White, Black, Asian or Hispanic/Latino are the most susceptible. All the other races stand. in between and have almost equal percentages.\n\n\nCode\npcc %&gt;%\n  filter(Group == \"By Gender identity\") %&gt;%\n  filter(Indicator == \"Ever experienced long COVID, as a percentage of adults who ever had COVID\" | Indicator == \"Currently experiencing long COVID, as a percentage of adults who ever had COVID\") %&gt;%\n  select(Subgroup, Phase, Value, Indicator) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Subgroup, y = Value, fill = Indicator)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"summary\",fun=\"mean\", position='dodge') +\n  facet_wrap(~ Phase) +\n  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c(\"Currently experiencing long COVID\", \"Ever experienced long COVID\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Percentage per Gender Identity\", x = \"Gender Identity\", y = \"Average Percentage\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n    coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nWe already covered the comparison between males and females but now we can notice that transgender individuals’ percentages are 2-3 times larger than those of males and sometimes double of that of females as well. Those differences are observed among the persons experiencing long COVID each period but for the ones claiming to ever have experienced, the pattern is the same but the differences are not that big. The percentages of transgender people still remain almost double of the corresponding male ones.\nHowever, we can notice that the dataset is not so trustworthy because of the sampling not being representative. one would expect the “ever experienced” percentage to rise during every period since this is a cumulative indicator by default. In reality though, the percentages of the cis-gender individuals remain relatively stable while for the transgender ones there is a significant increase on phases 3.5 and 3.8.\nThe fact that the percentages of each category remain stable can maybe be explained by the fact that the long COVID symptoms remain for years sometimes so since the data were gathered bi-weekly, each phase lasts 2 months and we don’t have more than 1.5 years of data, not enough time passed for others to pinpoint their symptoms as long COVID ones.\n\n\nCode\npcc %&gt;%\n  filter(Group == \"By Sexual orientation\") %&gt;%\n  filter(Indicator == \"Ever experienced long COVID, as a percentage of adults who ever had COVID\" | Indicator == \"Currently experiencing long COVID, as a percentage of adults who ever had COVID\") %&gt;%\n  select(Subgroup, Phase, Value, Indicator) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Subgroup, y = Value, fill = Indicator)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"summary\",fun=\"mean\", position='dodge') +\n  facet_wrap(~ Phase) +\n  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c(\"Currently experiencing long COVID\", \"Ever experienced long COVID\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Percentage per Sexual orientation\", x = \"Sexual orientation\", y = \"Average Percentage\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nWe wouldn’t expect the sexual orientation to play a role to whether someone develops long COVID but according to those graphs we can deduct that while the percentages of straight and gay/lesbian are roughly equal, the percentages of bisexual people are about one third higher for almost all periods.\n\n\nCode\npcc %&gt;%\n  filter(Group == \"By Education\") %&gt;%\n  filter(Indicator == \"Ever experienced long COVID, as a percentage of adults who ever had COVID\" | Indicator == \"Currently experiencing long COVID, as a percentage of adults who ever had COVID\") %&gt;%\n  select(Subgroup, Phase, Value, Indicator) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Subgroup, y = Value, fill = Indicator)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position='dodge') +\n  facet_wrap(~ Phase) +\n  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c(\"Currently experiencing long COVID\", \"Ever experienced long COVID\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Percentage per Education\", x = \"Education level\", y = \"Average Percentage\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the level of education is concerned, we can observe that the higher the educational level, the lower the percentages were at first. But as the time/phases pass, the percentage of people having a bachelor’s degree or higher lies always a little lower while all the other percentages are roughly equal, with the percentage of people with some college/associate’s degree always being slighlty higher.\n\n\nCode\npcc %&gt;%\n  filter(Group == \"By Disability status\") %&gt;%\n  filter(Indicator == \"Ever experienced long COVID, as a percentage of adults who ever had COVID\" | Indicator == \"Currently experiencing long COVID, as a percentage of adults who ever had COVID\") %&gt;%\n  select(Subgroup, Phase, Value, Indicator) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Subgroup, y = Value, fill = Indicator)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"summary\",fun=\"mean\", position='dodge') +\n  facet_wrap(~ Phase) +\n  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c(\"Currently experiencing long COVID\", \"Ever experienced long COVID\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Percentage per Disability status\", x = \"Disability status\", y = \"Average Percentage\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether someone is disabled or not seems to be the most impactful factor, since disabled people percentages are 2-3 times higher than those of the non-disabled ones and this pattern can be observed during all phases and both among those claiming to be currently experiencing during each phase and those claiming to have ever experienced."

    "text": "3.3 Exploring the impact of Long COVID on activity limitations\nIn our data set, the CDC measured the impact of Long COVID on overall health using questions about activity, looking at both those currently experiencing any activity limitations due to Long COVID and those currently experiencing significant activity limitations due to Long COVID (for more details as to the differences between these groups, please see the data overview section). To get an overview of the effect of Long COVID on health, we first wanted to see if Long COVID truly has a tangible impact on health. To do so, we returned to using national estimates of Long COVID (stored in rows contianing a value of “National Estimate” in the Group column), and specifically focused on the indicators of activity limiations over time.\n\n\nCode\n# Can re-use the TimeData dataframe that we created earlier to analyze time series data for question 1:\nAnyActivityLimits &lt;- TimeData %&gt;% filter(Indicator == \"Any activity limitations from long COVID, as a percentage of adults who currently have long COVID\" | Indicator == \"Any activity limitations from long COVID, as a percentage of all adults\")\n\nAnyActivityLimits &lt;- na.omit(AnyActivityLimits)\n\nAnyActivityLimits$Indicator &lt;- recode(AnyActivityLimits$Indicator, \"Any activity limitations from long COVID, as a percentage of adults who currently have long COVID\" = \"As a % of Adults who have ever had Long COVID\", \"Any activity limitations from long COVID, as a percentage of all adults\" = \"As a % of All Adults\")\n\nggplot(AnyActivityLimits, aes(x = Time.Period.Start.Date, y = Value, color = Indicator)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"Currently experiencing any Activity Limitations\") + \n  xlab(\"Data Collection Start Date\") +\n  ylab(\"Percentage\") +\n  scale_x_date(labels = scales::date_format(\"%b, %Y\"), breaks = \"3 month\") +\n  theme_linedraw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  labs(color = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph above suggests that most adults with Long COVID are also experiencing some degree of activity limitations, as throughout the past year the proportion of adults that have experienced any activity limitations out of all adults thaat have ever had Long COVID has hovered around 80%. While much lower, there is also a noticable proportion of adults with activity limitations from Long COVID out of all adults, around 6%. Additionally, this data suggests that this problem is pervasive, as the proportion of adults experiencing Long COVID-attributed activity limitations has remained consistent since September 2022.\nThe dataset also let us look at those experiencing significant activity limitations, in a similar analysis to the above.\n\n\nCode\nSignifActivityLimits &lt;- TimeData %&gt;% filter(Indicator == \"Significant activity limitations from long COVID, as a percentage of adults who currently have long COVID\" | Indicator == \"Significant activity limitations from long COVID, as a percentage of all adults\")\n\nSignifActivityLimits &lt;- na.omit(SignifActivityLimits)\n\nSignifActivityLimits$Indicator &lt;- recode(SignifActivityLimits$Indicator, \"Significant activity limitations from long COVID, as a percentage of adults who currently have long COVID\" = \"As a % of Adults who have ever had Long COVID\", \"Significant activity limitations from long COVID, as a percentage of all adults\" = \"As a % of All Adults\")\n\nggplot(SignifActivityLimits, aes(x = Time.Period.Start.Date, y = Value, color = Indicator)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"Currently experiencing Significant Activity Limitations\") + \n  xlab(\"Data Collection Start Date\") +\n  ylab(\"Percentage\") +\n  scale_x_date(labels = scales::date_format(\"%b, %Y\"), breaks = \"3 month\") +\n  theme_linedraw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  labs(color = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, the same trends as above are visible, albeit to a lesser extent. From this information, we concluded that of those that experience post-COVID symptoms, many (around 25%) experience some form of a lasting, significant impact to their overall health. There is also a non-zero proportion of all adults in the U.S. that experience significant health ramifications related to COVID (around 1.5%), suggesting that COVID presents a significant risk for developing adverse health events even when looking at the entire U.S. population."
