## Investigating the Trends in Long COVID Prevalence

Our initial objective was to gain insight into the prevalence of Long COVID in the United States. Ultimately, our goal is to figure out what groups are affected most by Long COVID in order to best inform health policy officials when it comes to allocation of resources for diagnosis and treatment, but if Long COVID has low prevalence or shows decreasing trends in prevalence, these interventions might have limited efficacy. As such, it is important to first establish a baseline of what overall proportion of adults in the United States are either currently experiencing post-COVID-related symptoms, or have experienced such symptoms in the past.
