# Post-Covid Conditions

While much has been uncovered about the spread, symptoms, and overall pathology of COVID-19, much is still unknown about the long-term effects of COVID-19 after infection. In this project, we attempt to not only investigate the extent of post-COVID symptoms among adults in the United States, but look to see if certain demographics are more susceptible to developing post-COVID symptoms than others. We hope you enjoy our analysis, and feel free to email us if you have any questions surrounding the project!

Best,
Isaac and Katerina
