    "text": "1 Introduction\nFor most people infected with COVID-19, the symptoms are no more than a common cold, including fever or chills, cough, and fatigue. However, for some infected with COVID-19, the symptoms can continue for weeks, months, or even years after contracting the disease. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), alongside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has defined these extended symptoms as Long COVID. Specifically, the CDC has defined Long COVID as “signs, symptoms, and conditions that continue or develop after acute COVID-19 infection”. An overview of the various symptoms and their approximate prevalence can be seen below:\n\nDue to the widespread presence of COVID-19 in the United States, especially looking at the past three years, interest in the long-term effects of COVID-19 infection has been high among scientific researchers and public health officials alike. However, while research has shown that people who experience more severe COVID-19 symptoms are more likely to develop Long COVID, including those who are unvaccinated, little is known about who exactly experiences Long COVID and why. This discrepancy between the high prevalence of Long COVID and the relatively little known about it inspired us to dig deeper into Long COVID datasets, in order to gain insight into what demographics are most likely to suffer long-term effects from COVID-19. In particular, we are interested in the following questions:\n\nHow big of a problem actually is Long COVID? Have reported cases increased over the past year, decreased, or remained relatively constant, and what percentage of adults in the US are actually impacted?\nDo factors like age, education, disability status, or geographic location impact the likelihood to develop Long COVID? If so, what factors are most impactful?\nWhat impact does Long COVID have on various health metrics, such as level of fatigue or activity metrics?\n\nBy answering these questions, we hope to better inform health policy officials when it comes to allocation of resources for diagnosing and treating Long COVID. Additionally, we aim to answer questions as to the true effects of Long COVID on health when viewed on a large scale.\nReferences:\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Long_term_covid-19.jpg\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html\nhttps://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Post-COVID-Conditions/gsea-w83j\nhttps://catalog.data.gov/dataset/post-covid-conditions-89bb3"

    "section": "2.1 Description",
    "text": "2.1 Description\n\n2.1.1 Dataset Source\nThe dataset used for this project is survey data from the Household Pulse Survey, a survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau designed to measure household experiences during the coronavirus pandemic. The Household Pulse Survey was administered starting in April 2020, and has been routinely administered on a two-weeks on, two-weeks off cycle since then. More complete information on the survey can be found on the Census Bureau website here, and the exact timing of data collection can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to analyze the prevalence and effects of Long COVID among various demographics, we used a subset of the questions asked on the Household Pulse Survey that were specific to post-COVID-19 conditions. These questions focus on the occurrence of COVID symptoms that lasted at least three months post-testing positive for COVID-19, and were introduced beginning in Phase 3.5 of the Household Pulse Survey (on June 1, 2022). Responses to these questions were then collated by the National Center for Health Statistics, which were then published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This dataset, which was last updated on October 12, 2023 (following the conclusion of Phase 3.9) can be found on the CDC website here.\n\n\n2.1.2 Dataset Overview\nThe dataset was directly downloaded from the CDC as a csv file. It consists of 14 columns and 11376 rows and contains the estimates of:\n\nThe percentage of all U.S. adults who said they ever had COVID.\nThe percentage of all U.S. adults who ever experienced post-COVID conditions.\nThe percentage of all U.S. adults who ever experienced post-COVID conditions among those who ever had COVID.\nThe percentage of all U.S. adults who are currently experiencing post-COVID conditions.\nThe percentage of adults who are currently experiencing post-COVID conditions (long COVID) among those who ever had COVID.\n\nAdditionally, starting on September 14, 2022 (Phase 3.6) the following responses were also included:\n\nThe percentage of U.S. adults currently experiencing any activity limitations (either ‘yes, a little’ or ‘yes, a lot’ responses) from long COVID, either among adults who are currently experiencing long COVID or among all adults.\nThe percentage of U.S. adults currently experiencing significant activity limitations (‘yes, a lot’ response) from long COVID, either among adults who are currently experiencing long COVID or among all adults.\n\nThe primary columns of the dataset are:\n\nIndicator: one of the categories (a-g) presented above.\nGroup: The grouping of the population on which the percentages are measured. Included groupings are National Estimate (aggregated proportion across all U.S. adults), age, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, education status, disability status, and state.\nState: Either the state that the state grouping corresponds to (if applicable), or United States.\nSubgroup: The category within the group specified by Group if not grouped by state, or equal to state otherwise.\nPhase, Time Period, Time Period Label: values regarding the time period of the data collection, including the Phase of data collection, time period the data was collected, and label for the time period.\nTime Period Start Date\nTime Period End Date\nValue: Estimate of the proportion of adults experiencing symptoms, with exact symptoms and conditions outlined in the indicator, group, and subgroup columns.\n\nThe dataset contains additional columns with confidence intervals and quartile information as related to the value column. Specifically, the dataset contains columns for the low confidence interval bound (LowCl), high confidence interval bound (HighCl), Confidence Interval, Quartile Number (Either 1, 2, 3, or 4), and Quartile Range. An additional column Suppression Flag is also present, which contains a value of 1 if the value in Value is unreliable and is empty otherwise. \nAs part of the data release process, the CDC also acknowledged several limitations and concerns with the study, which are outlined in full on the CDC summary page for the Household Pulse Survey found here. The most important limitations and concerns are outlined below:\n\nThroughout the duration of the data collection process, response rates across various demographics were relatively low. In fact, when adjusted for nonresponse and to match Census Bureau estimates of the population by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment, response rates ranged from 3.9%-7.3%, which is much lower than most federally-sponsored surveys.\nConfidence intervals included in the tables on this page only reflect the potential for sampling error. These intervals do not account for various nonsampling errors, including measurement errors, nonresponse errors, or processing errors. \nThe percentage of adults who said they ever had COVID based on the Household Pulse Survey is lower than other estimates based on seroprevalence studies. This discrepancy between reported COVID cases and true COVID cases based on blood serum is likely due to the relatively high percentage of asymptomatic individuals with COVID, but is still worth noting."
